# Weather app

Notes:
* My learning goal is to understand how to use a third party API
* I'll know I've met this goal if:
  - I've accessed data from 3 different weather API's and presented some data back to an end user
  - I've used 3 API keys and kept them hidden
* Don't worry about robust testing or whether the interface is usable, focus on accessing data through an API call
